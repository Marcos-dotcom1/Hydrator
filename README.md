## 📖 Hydrator — Simple Water Reminder

**Hydrator** is a lightweight app that reminds you to drink water at custom intervals throughout the day.

## 📦 Installation

1. 📥 Download the latest release from the **`dist`** folder in this repository:

   - [Download Hydrator.exe](https://github.com/Marcos-dotcom1/Hydrator/tree/main/dist)

2. 📂 Place both files in the same folder:

   - `Hydrator.exe`
   - `settings.json` (comes with your first download)

> **⚠️ Important:**
> Do **not** delete or move `settings.json`. The app reads your custom times and preferences from this file every time it runs.

## 🚨 First Run & Windows Security Warning

Since Hydrator isn’t signed with a trusted certificate (Im an indie developers out here), Windows Defender SmartScreen will likely show a warning:

1. When the warning appears, click **More info**.
2. Then click **Run anyway**.

---

## 🥤 How it Works

- Hydrator calculates reminder times based on your start and end time.
- A popup will appear at each scheduled time, telling you how much to drink.
- Click **OK** to dismiss the reminder.
- If **troll_mode** is on and you click **No**, the popup will show again until you accept.

---

## 💻 No Installation Required

Hydrator is **portable** — no installation needed, no extra software required.
Just download and run.

---

## ✨ Notes

- Windows might flag unsigned `.exe` files as suspicious — this is normal for personal or indie apps.
- Don’t delete `settings.json` unless you really mean to reset your settings.

---

## ⚰️ Uninstalling

Just delete:

- `Hydrator.exe`
- `settings.json`

That’s it — no registry entries, no hidden files.
